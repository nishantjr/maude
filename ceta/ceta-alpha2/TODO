TODO:
* Add switch --debug
* Figure out plan for associative case.
* Decide if a context free grammar with rules of the following form always
specifies a regular language:
  v -> a
  v -> v u
  v -> u v
where a is a terminal and u,v are nonterminals.
* Figure out connections between cfgs, specific equational theories, and
  logic.
* Extend earley.hh so that membership testing gives the specific rule that
  implies membeship.
* Add test case for fasubset.hh
* Develop learn.hh so that equivalence uses classifier_t directly and 
  membership allows storing the parse trace in the tree for improved
  performance.
